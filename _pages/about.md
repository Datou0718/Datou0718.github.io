I'm Yi-Chun Liao (廖奕鈞), a undergraduate student in [department of Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw//?locale=en) at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). Recently I'm working on a project focused on realizing best-match functionality across multiple content-addressable memory (CAM) tiles under the supervision of [Prof. Sharon Hu](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/xiaobo-sharon-hu/) at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu).

Research Interests
======
Although AI and ML have advanced formidably in recent years, much of the progress remains too resource-intensive for many practical deployments. My research interests focus on bridging this gap, enhancing resource-efficiency through research in areas such as:
- Compute-in-Memory
- Hardware-Software Codesign
- Emerging Non-Volatile Memory (i.e., PCM, ReRAM, FeFET)
- Edge AI/ML
- Energy Efficiency

Personal Interests
======
- Reading Papers
- Cooking & Tasting
- Traveling
